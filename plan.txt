To DO:
1. Convert all instances of __dirname to be compatible with windows
2. Remove auto update - too unreliable each year
3. address the discrepency of max year in the rates table being used in absense; we might want to use the max year that is possible for that query instead.
- will need to have an option to turn it off for debugging; ie to test out if data got loaded successfully for a given year
